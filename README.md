# Last.fm live recommender

This is a simple web page to listen to the previews of recommended artists based on what you usually listen to. Introducing your Last.fm API key and an user, you can get that user's top listened artists and clicking on them you get recommendations based on those artists. Also, thanks to the Spotify API you can listen to the preview of the top listened song for each recommended artist, just by selecting it.

*This mashup is done with the main purpose of testing Last.fm and Spotify APIs by creating a responsive HTML5 + CSS3 + JS web page.*
